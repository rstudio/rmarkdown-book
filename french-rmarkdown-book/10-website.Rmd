# Websites

Most R Markdown applications are single documents. That is, you have a single R Markdown source document, and it generates a single output file. However, it is also possible to work with multiple Rmd documents in a project, and organize them in a meaningful way (e.g., pages can reference each other).

Currently there are two major ways to build multiple Rmd documents: **blogdown** [@xie2017; @R-blogdown] for building websites, and **bookdown** [@xie2016; @R-bookdown] for authoring books. In this chapter, we briefly introduce the **blogdown** package.\index{blogdown} For the full reference, please read the official **blogdown** book by @xie2017. In fact, the **rmarkdown** package also has a built-in site generator, which was not covered in detail by the **blogdown** book, so we will introduce it in Section \@ref(rmarkdown-site).

With **blogdown**, you can write a blog post or a general page in an Rmd document, or a plain Markdown document. These source documents will be built into a static website\index{static website}, which is essentially a folder containing static HTML files and associated assets (such as images and CSS files). You can publish this folder to any web server as a website. Because it is only a single folder, it can be easy to maintain. For example, you do not need to worry about databases as you do if you use dynamic systems like WordPress.

Because the website is generated from R Markdown, the content is more likely to be reproducible, and also easier to maintain (no cut-and-paste of results). Using Markdown means your content could be more portable in the sense that you may convert your pages to PDF or other formats in the future, and you are not tied to the default HTML format. For example, you may be able to convert a blog post to a journal paper, or several posts to a book. One more benefit of using **blogdown** is that the Markdown syntax is based on **bookdown**'s extended syntax, which means it is highly suitable for technical writing. For example, you may write math equations, insert figures or tables with captions, cross-reference them with figure or table numbers, add citations, and present theorems or proofs.

## Get started {#blogdown-start}

You can install **blogdown** from CRAN. If you want to test the development version, you may also install it from GitHub:

```r
# from CRAN
install.packages("blogdown")

# or the development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github("rstudio/blogdown")
```

The easiest way to get started with a **blogdown**-based website is to create a website project from RStudio: `File -> New Project`. If you do not use RStudio, you may call the function `blogdown::new_site()`.

The first time when you create a new website, **blogdown** will do a series of things behind the scenes: it downloads Hugo\index{Hugo} (the default static site generator), creates a website skeleton, installs a theme, adds some example posts, builds the site, and serves it so that you can see the website in your browser (or RStudio Viewer if you are in RStudio). It will not go through all these steps again the next time when you work on this website. All you need in the future is `blogdown::serve_site()`, or equivalently, the RStudio addin "Serve Site".

Every time you open a website project, you only need to serve the site once, and **blogdown** will keep running in the background, listening to changes in your source files, and rebuilding the website automatically. All you have to do is create new posts, or edit existing posts, and save them. You will see the automatic live preview as you save the changes (unless you have errors in a source document).

There are a few RStudio addins to help you author your posts: you can use the "New Post" addin to create a new post, the "Update Metadata" addin to update the YAML metadata of a post, and the "Insert Image" addin to insert an image in a post.

## The directory structure {#blogdown-directory}

The default site generator in **blogdown** is Hugo (https://gohugo.io). A basic Hugo website usually contains the following files and directories:

- `config.toml`
- `content/`
- `static/`
- `themes/`
- `public/`

The configuration file `config.toml` can be used to specify options for the Hugo website, e.g.,

```ini
baseURL = "/"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "A Hugo website"
theme = "hugo-lithium-theme"
```

Some options are provided by Hugo itself, such as `title` and `baseURL`; you may refer to https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/ for all built-in options. Some options are provided by the Hugo theme, and you need to read the documentation of the specific theme to know the additional options.

All source Markdown or R Markdown files should be placed under the `content/` directory. The directory structure under `content/` can be arbitrary.

The `static/` directory contains static assets such as images and CSS files. Everything under `static/` will be copied to the `public/` directory when Hugo generates the website. For example, `static/images/foo.png` will be copied to `public/images/foo.png`, and if you want to include this image in your post, you may use `![title](/images/foo.png)` in Markdown (the leading `/` typically indicates the root of `public/`).

You can download multiple themes to the `themes` directory. To activate a theme, specify its folder name in the `theme` option in `config.toml`. You can find a lot of Hugo themes from https://themes.gohugo.io. Remember, the best theme is always the next one, i.e., one that you have not used before. I recommend that you start with a simple theme (such as the default [hugo-lithium theme](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium) in **blogdown**, [hugo-xmin](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin), or [hugo-tanka](https://github.com/road2stat/hugo-tanka)), and write a substantial number of posts before seriously investing time in choosing or tweaking a theme.

After you serve a site using **blogdown**, your site will be continuously built to the `public/` directory by default. You can upload this folder to any web server to deploy the website. However, if you know GIT, there is an even easier way to publish your website, to be introduced in the next section.

Hugo is very powerful and customizable. If you want to learn more technical details about it, you may read Chapter 2 of the **blogdown** book.

## Deployment {#blogdown-deploy}

There are multiple ways to deploy a website, such as using your own web server, GitHub Pages, or Amazon S3. We only mention one in this chapter: Netlify (https://www.netlify.com). It provides both free and paid plans. For personal users, the free plan may be enough, because many useful features have been included in the free plan, e.g., the Hugo support, CDN (content delivery network) for high availability and performance of your website, HTTPS, binding your custom domain, and 301/302 redirects.

Netlify currently supports GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. You may log in using one of these accounts at https://app.netlify.com, and create a new website from your GIT repository that contains the source of your website. Note that you do not need to commit or push the `public/` directory in GIT (in fact, I recommend that you ignore this directory in `.gitignore`).

When creating a new site on Netlify, you can specify the build command to be `hugo`, the publish directory to be `public` (unless you changed the setting `publishDir` in `config.toml`), and also add an environment variable `HUGO_VERSION` with a value of a suitable Hugo version (e.g., `0.39`). To find the Hugo version on your local computer, call the function `blogdown::hugo_version()`. You may want to use the same Hugo version on Netlify.

Netlify will assign a random subdomain of the form `xxx-xxx-1234.netlify.com` to you. You may change it to a meaningful domain name, or request a free `*.rbind.io` domain name from https://github.com/rbind/support/issues if you like it.

If possible, I strongly recommend that you enable HTTPS for your websites ([why?](https://https.cio.gov/everything/)). HTTPS is free on Netlify, so you really do not have a reason not to enable it.

Once your GIT repository is connected with Netlify, you only need to push source files to the repository in the future, and Netlify will automatically rebuild your website. This is called "continuous deployment".

## Other site generators {#blogdown-other}

Currently **blogdown** has limited support for two other popular site generators: [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Hexo](https://hexo.io). You can find detailed instructions on how to configure **blogdown** for these site generators in Chapter 5 of the **blogdown** book. Note that neither Pandoc's Markdown nor HTML widgets are supported if you use Jekyll or Hexo with **blogdown**.

## rmarkdown's site generator {#rmarkdown-site}

Before **blogdown** was invented, the **rmarkdown** package had provided a simple site generator that did not rely on a third-party site generator like Hugo. If you feel Hugo is too complex for you, and you only want to build a few Rmd documents into a website, this built-in site generator may be a good choice. A main restriction of this site generator is that it assumes all Rmd documents are under a flat directory (i.e., no pages under subdirectories). It also has fewer features compared to Hugo (e.g., no RSS feeds).

You can render collections of R Markdown documents as a website using the `rmarkdown::render_site()` function. We will call such websites "R Markdown websites" in this section. The RStudio IDE (version 1.0 or higher) also includes integrated support for developing R Markdown websites.

### A simple example

To start with, let's walk through a very simple example, a website that includes two pages (`Home` and `About`) and a navigation bar to switch between them.

First, we need a configuration file `_site.yml`:

```yaml
name: "my-website"
navbar:
  title: "My Website"
  left:
    - text: "Home"
      href: index.html
    - text: "About"
      href: about.html
```

Then two Rmd files, `index.Rmd`:

```markdown
---
title: "My Website"
---

Hello, Website!
```

and `about.Rmd`:

```markdown
---
title: "About This Website"
---

More about this website.
```

Note that the minimum requirement for any R Markdown website is that it have an `index.Rmd` file as well as a `_site.yml` file. If you execute the `rmarkdown::render_site()` function from within the directory containing the website, the following will occur:

1. All of the `*.Rmd` and `*.md` files in the root website directory will be rendered into HTML. Note, however, that Markdown files beginning with `_` are not rendered (this is a convention to designate files that are to be included by top level Rmd documents as child documents).

1. The generated HTML files and any supporting files (e.g., CSS and JavaScript) are copied into an output directory (`_site` by default).

The HTML files within the `_site` directory are now ready to deploy as a standalone static website.

The full source code for the simple example above can be found in the `hello-website` folder in the repository <https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown-website-examples>.

### Site authoring

#### RStudio

RStudio includes a variety of features intended to make developing R Markdown websites more productive.

All of the RStudio features for website authoring described below require the use of an RStudio Project tied to your website's directory. See the documentation on [RStudio Projects](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects) for additional information on how to create and use projects.

As you work on the individual pages of your website, you can render them using the `Knit` button just as you do with conventional standalone R Markdown documents (see Figure \@ref(fig:site-page)).

```{r site-page, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Knit a single page of a website.', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/site-page.png', dpi = NA)
```

Knitting an individual page will only render and preview that page, not the other pages in the website.

To render all of the pages in the website, you use the `Build` pane, which calls `rmarkdown::render_site()` to build and then preview the entire site (see Figure \@ref(fig:site-build)).

```{r site-build, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Build an entire website in RStudio.', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/site-build.png', dpi = NA)
```

RStudio supports "live preview" of changes that you make to supporting files within your website (e.g., CSS, JavaScript, Rmd partials, R scripts, and YAML config files).

Changes to CSS and JavaScript files always result in a refresh of the currently active page preview. Changes to other files (e.g., shared scripts and configuration files) trigger a rebuild of the active page (this behavior can be disabled via the options dialog available from the `Build` pane).

Note that only the active page is rebuilt, so once you are happy with the results of rendering you should make sure to rebuild the entire site from the `Build` pane to ensure that all pages inherit your changes.

When working iteratively on a page, you might find it more convenient to preview it side-by-side with the editor rather than in an external window. You can configure RStudio to do this using the options menu on the editor toolbar (see Figure \@ref(fig:site-preview)).

```{r site-preview, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Preview a page side-by-side with the editor in RStudio.', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/site-preview.png', dpi = NA)
```

#### Command line

If you are not working within RStudio and/or want to build sites from the command line, you can call the `render_site()` function directly from within the website directory. Pass no arguments to render the entire site or a single file in order to render just that file:

```r
# render the entire site
rmarkdown::render_site()

# render a single file only
rmarkdown::render_site("about.Rmd")
```

To clean up all of the files generated via `render_site()`, you can call the `clean_site()` function, which will remove all files generated by rendering your site's Markdown documents, including **knitr**'s `*_cache` directories. You can specify the `preview = FALSE` option to just list the files to be removed rather than actually removing them:

```r
# list which files will be removed
rmarkdown::clean_site(preview = TRUE)

# actually remove the files
rmarkdown::clean_site()
```

#### knitr caching

If your website is time consuming to render, you may want to enable **knitr**'s caching during the development of the site, so that you can more rapidly preview. To enable caching for an individual chunk, just add the `cache = TRUE` chunk option:

````markdown
`r ''````{r, cache = TRUE}
data <- longComputation()
```
````

To enable caching for an entire document, add `cache = TRUE` to the global chunk option defaults:

````markdown
`r ''````{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)
```
````

Note that when caching is enabled for an Rmd document, its `*_files` directory will be copied rather than moved to the `_site` directory (since the cache requires references to generated figures in the `*_files` directory).

### Common elements

#### Content

Typically when creating a website, there are various common elements you want to include on all pages (e.g., output options, CSS styles, header and footer elements, etc.). Here are additions in three files to the example above to make use of common elements:

- `_site.yml`:

    ```yaml
    name: "my-website"
    navbar:
      title: "My Website"
      left:
        - text: "Home"
          href: index.html
        - text: "About"
          href: about.html
    output:
      html_document:
        theme: cosmo
        highlight: textmate
        include:
          after_body: footer.html
        css: styles.css
    ```

- `footer.html`:

    ```html
    <p>Copyright &copy; 2016 Skynet, Inc. All rights reserved.</p>
    ```

- `styles.css`

    ```css
    blockquote {
      font-style: italic
    }
    ```

Note that we have included an `output` element within our `_site.yml` file. This defines shared output options for all R Markdown documents within a site. Note that individual documents can also include their own `output` options, which will be merged with the common options at render time.

As part of our common output options, we have specified an HTML footer (via the `include: after-body:` option) and a CSS stylesheet. You can also include HTML before the body or in the document's `<head>` tag (see Section \@ref(includes)).

In addition to whatever common options you define, there are two output options that are automatically set when rendering a site:

1. The `self_contained` option is set `FALSE`; and

1. The `lib_dir` option is set to `site_libs`.

These options are set so that dependent files (e.g., jQuery, Bootstrap, and HTML widget libraries) are shared across all documents within the site rather than redundantly embedded within each document.

#### R scripts

If you have R code that you would like to share across multiple R Markdown documents within your site, you can create an R script (e.g., `utils.R`) and source it within your Rmd files. For example:

````markdown
`r ''````{r}
source("utils.R")
```
````

#### Rmd partials

You may have common fragments of R Markdown that you want to share across pages within your site. To share Rmd fragments, you should name them with a leading underscore (`_`), and then include them within their parent Rmd document using the `child` chunk option. For example:

- `about.Rmd`:

    ````markdown
    ---
    title: "About This Website"
    ---

    More about this website.

    `r ''````{r, child="_session-info.Rmd"}
    ```
    ````

- `_session-info.Rmd`:

    ````markdown
    Session information:

    `r ''````{r}
    sessionInfo()
    ```
    ````

The leading underscore is an indicator to the site generation engine that the Rmd is a partial document to be included in other documents, so it is not compiled as a standalone document during site rendering.

The full source code for the above example can be found in the `common-element` folder in the repository <https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown-website-examples>.

### Site navigation

The `navbar` element of `_site.yml` can be used to define a common navigation bar for your website. You can include internal and external links on the navigation bar as well as drop-down menus for sites with a large number of pages.

Here is a navigation bar definition in `_site.yml` that makes use of a variety of features:

```yaml
name: "my-website"
navbar:
  title: "My Website"
  type: inverse
  left:
    - text: "Home"
      icon: fa-home
      href: index.html
    - text: "About"
      icon: fa-info
      href: about.html
    - text: "More"
      icon: fa-gear
      menu:
        - text: "Heading 1"
        - text: "Page A"
          href: page-a.html
        - text: "Page B"
          href: page-b.html
        - text: "---------"
        - text: "Heading 2"
        - text: "Page C"
          href: page-c.html
        - text: "Page D"
          href: page-d.html
  right:
    - icon: fa-question fa-lg
      href: https://example.com
```

This example demonstrates a number of capabilities of navigation bars:

1. You can use the `type` field to choose between the `default` and `inverse` navigation bar styles (each theme includes distinct colors for "default" and "inverse" navigation bars).

1. You can align navigational items either to the `left` or to the `right`.

1. You can include menus on the navigation bar, and those menus can have separators (`text: "--------------"`) and internal headings (`text` without a corresponding `href`).

1. You can include both internal and external links on the navigation bar.

1. You can use icons on the navigation bar. Icons from three different icon sets are available.

    - [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons)
    - [Ionicons](http://ionicons.com/)
    - [Bootstrap Glyphicons](https://getbootstrap.com/components/)

    When referring to an icon, you should use its full name including the icon set prefix (e.g., `fa-github`, `ion-social-twitter`, and `glyphicon-time`).

#### HTML navigation bar

If you want to have even more control over the appearance and behavior of the navigation bar, you can define it in HTML rather than YAML. If you include a file named `_navbar.html` in your website directory, it will be used as the navigation bar. Here is an example of navigation bar defined in HTML: <https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown-website/blob/master/_navbar.html>.

Full documentation on syntax of Bootstrap navigation bars can be found here: <http://getbootstrap.com/components/>.

### HTML generation

R Markdown includes many facilities for generation of HTML content from R objects, including:

- The conversion of standard R output types (e.g., textual output and plots) within code chunks done automatically by **knitr**.

- A variety of ways to generate HTML tables, including the `knitr::kable()` function and other packages such as **kableExtra** and **pander**.

- A large number of available HTML widgets that provide rich JavaScript data visualizations.

As a result, for many R Markdown websites you will not need to worry about generating HTML output at all (since it is created automatically).

#### The htmltools package

If the facilities described above do not meet your requirements, you can also generate custom HTML from your R code using the **htmltools** package [@R-htmltools]. The **htmltools** package enables you to write HTML using a convenient R based syntax (this is the same core HTML generation facility used by the **shiny** package).

Here is an example of an R function that creates a Bootstrap thumbnail div:

```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
library(htmltools)
thumbnail <- function(title, img, href, caption = TRUE) {
  div(class = "col-sm-4",
      a(class = "thumbnail", title = title, href = href,
        img(src = img),
        div(class = if (caption) "caption",
            if (caption) title)
      )
  )
}
```

You can write functions that build HTML like the one above, then call them from other R code that combines them with your data to produce dynamic HTML. An R code chunk that makes use of this function might look like this:

````markdown
`r ''````{r, echo=FALSE}
thumbnail("Apple", "images/apple.png",
          "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple")
thumbnail("Grape", "images/grape.png",
          "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape")
thumbnail("Peach", "images/peach.png",
          "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peach")
```
````

### Site configuration

The `_site.yml` file has a number of options that affect site output, including where it is written and what files are included and excluded from the site. Here is an example that makes use of a few of these options:

```yaml
name: "my-website"
output_dir: "_site"
include: ["import.R"]
exclude: ["docs.txt", "*.csv"]
```

The `name` field provides a suggested URL path for your website when it is published (by default this is just the name of the directory containing the site).

The `output_dir` field indicates which directory to copy site content into (`"_site"` is the default if none is specified). It can be `"."` to keep all content within the root website directory alongside the source code.

#### Included files

The `include` and `exclude` fields enable you to override the default behavior vis-a-vis what files are copied into the output directory. By default, all files within the website directory are copied into the output directory save for the following:

1. Files beginning with `.` (hidden files).

2. Files beginning with `_`.

3. Files known to contain R source code (e.g., `*.R`, `*.s`, `*.Rmd`), R data (e.g., `*.RData`, `*..rds`), or configuration data (e.g., `*..Rproj`, `rsconnect`).

The `include` and `exclude` fields of `_site.yml` can be used to override this default behavior (wildcards can be used to specify groups of files to be included or excluded).

Note that `include` and `exclude` are *not* used to determine which Rmd files are rendered: all of them in the root directory save for those named with the `_` prefix will be rendered.

### Publishing websites

R Markdown websites are static HTML sites that can be deployed to any standard web server. All site content (generated documents and supporting files) are copied into the `_site` directory, so deployment is simply a matter of moving that directory to the appropriate directory of a web server.

### Additional examples

Here are some additional examples of websites created with R Markdown:

- The **rmarkdown** documentation: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com. This website was created using R Markdown. There are a large number of pages (over 40) that are organized using sub-menus on the navigation bar. Disqus comments are included on each page via an `after_body` option. The source code is at https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/tree/gh-pages.

- The **flexdashboard** documentation: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/. It illustrates using an R script to dynamically generate HTML thumbnails of **flexdashboard** examples from YAML. The source code is at https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/tree/gh-pages/flexdashboard.

### Custom site generators

So far we have described the behavior of the default site generation function, `rmarkdown::default_site()`. It is also possible to define a custom site generator that has alternate behaviors.

#### Site generator function

A site generator is an R function that is bound to by including it in the `site:` field of the `index.Rmd` or `index.md` file. For example:

```yaml
---
title: "My Book"
output: bookdown::gitbook
site: bookdown::bookdown_site
---
```

A site generation function should return a list with the following elements:

- `name`: The name for the website (e.g., the parent directory name).

- `output_dir`: The directory where the website output is written to. This path should be relative to the site directory (e.g., `"."` or `"_site"`).

- `render`: An R function that can be called to generate the site. The function should accept the `input_file`, `output_format`, `envir`, `quiet`, and `encoding` arguments.

- `clean`: An R function that returns relative paths to the files generated by `render_site()`. These files are the ones to be removed by the `clean_site()` function.

Note that the `input_file` argument will be `NULL` when the entire site is being generated. It will be set to a specific filename if a front-end tool is attempting to preview it (e.g., RStudio IDE via the `Knit` button).

When `quiet = FALSE`, the `render` function should also print a line of output using the `message()` function indicating which output file should be previewed. For example:

```r
if (!quiet)
  message("\nOutput created: ", output)
```

Emitting this line enables front-ends like RStudio to determine which file they should open to preview the website.

#### Examples

See the source code of the `rmarkdown::default_site` function for an example of a site generation function. The **bookdown** package also implements a custom site generator via its `bookdown::bookdown_site` function.
