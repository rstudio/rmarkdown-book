# Dashboards

R Markdown is customizable and extensible. In Chapters \@ref(documents) and \@ref(presentations), we have introduced basic document and presentation formats in the **rmarkdown** package, and explained how to customize them. From this chapter, we will show several more existing extension packages that bring different styles, layouts, and applications to the R Markdown ecosystem. In this chapter, we introduce dashboards based on the **flexdashboard** package [@R-flexdashboard]\index{flexdashboard}.

Dashboards are particularly common in business-style reports. They can be used to highlight brief and key summaries of a report. The layout of a dashboard is often grid-based, with components arranged in boxes of various sizes.

With the **flexdashboard** package, you can

- Use R Markdown to publish a group of related data visualizations as a dashboard.

- Embed a wide variety of components including HTML widgets, R graphics, tabular data, gauges, value boxes, and text annotations.

- Specify row or column-based layouts (components are intelligently re-sized to fill the browser and adapted for display on mobile devices).

- Create story boards for presenting sequences of visualizations and related commentary.

- Optionally use Shiny to drive visualizations dynamically.

To author a dashboard, you create an R Markdown document with the `flexdashboard::flex_dashboard` output format. You can also create a document from within RStudio using the `File -> New File -> R Markdown` dialog, and choosing a "Flex Dashboard" template.

If you are not using RStudio, you can create a new `flexdashboard` R Markdown file from the R console:

```r
rmarkdown::draft(
  "dashboard.Rmd", template = "flex_dashboard",
  package = "flexdashboard"
)
```

The full documentation of **flexdashboard** is at https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/. We will only cover some basic features and usage in this chapter. Dashboards have many features in common with HTML documents (Section \@ref(html-document)), such as figure options (Section \@ref(figure-options)), appearance and style (Section \@ref(appearance-and-style)), MathJax equations (Section \@ref(mathjax-equations)), header and before/after body includes (Section \@ref(includes)), and Pandoc arguments (Section \@ref(pandoc-arguments)), and so on. We also recommend that you take a look at the R help page `?flexdashboard::flex_dashboard` to learn about more features and options.

## Layout

The overall rule about the dashboard layout is that a first-level section generates a page, a second-level section generates a column (or a row), and a third-level section generates a box (that contains one or more dashboard components). Below is a quick example:

````markdown
`r xfun::file_string('examples/dashboard/01-start.Rmd')`
````

Note that a series of dashes under a line of text is the alternative Markdown syntax for the second-level section header, i.e.,

```markdown
Column 1
--------------------------------------------------
```

is equivalent to

```markdown
## Column 1
```

We used a series of dashes just to make the second-level sections stand out in the source document. By default, the second-level sections generate columns on a dashboard, and the third level sections will be stacked vertically inside columns. You do not have to have columns on a dashboard: when all you have are the third-level sections in the source document, they will be stacked vertically as one column in the output.

The text of the second-level headers will not be displayed in the output. The second-level headers are for the sole purpose of layout, so the actual content of the headers does not matter at all. By contrast, the first-level and third-level headers will be displayed as titles.

Figure \@ref(fig:dashboard-start) shows the output of the above example, in which you can see two columns, with the first column containing "Chart A", and the second column containing "Chart B" and "Chart C". We did not really include any R code in the code chunks, so all boxes are empty. In these code chunks, you may write arbitrary R code that generates R plots, HTML widgets, and various other components to be introduced in Section \@ref(dashboard-components).

```{r dashboard-start, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='A quick example of the dashboard layout.', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/dashboard-start.png', dpi = NA)
```

### Row-based layouts

You may change the column-oriented layout to the row-oriented layout through the `orientation` option, e.g.,

```yaml
output:
  flexdashboard::flex_dashboard:
    orientation: rows
```

That means the second-level sections will be rows, and the third-level sections will be arranged as columns within rows.

### Attributes on sections

The second-level section headers may have attributes on them, e.g., you can set the width of a column to 350:

```markdown
A narrow column {data-width=350}
--------------------------------
```

For the row-oriented layout, you can set the `data-height` attribute for rows. The `{.tabset}` attribute can be applied on a column so that the third-level sections will be arranged in tabs, e.g.,

```markdown
Two tabs {.tabset}
------------------

### Tab A

### Tab B
```

### Multiple pages

When you have multiple first-level sections in the document, they will be displayed as separate pages on the dashboard. Below is an example, and Figure \@ref(fig:dashboard-pages) shows the output. Note that a series of equal signs is the alternative Markdown syntax for the first-level section headers (you can use a single pound sign `#`, too).

````markdown
`r xfun::file_string('examples/dashboard/02-pages.Rmd')`
````

Page titles are displayed as a navigation menu at the top of the dashboard. In this example, we applied icons to page titles through the `data-icon` attribute. You can find other available icons from https://fontawesome.com.

```{r dashboard-pages, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Multiple pages on a dashboard.', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/dashboard-pages.png', dpi = NA)
```

### Story boards

Besides the column and row-based layouts, you may present a series of visualizations and related commentary through the "storyboard" layout. To enable this layout, you use the option `storyboard`. Below is an example, and Figure \@ref(fig:dashboard-story) shows the output, in which you can see left/right navigation buttons at the top to help you go through all visualizations and associated commentaries one by one.

````markdown
`r xfun::file_string('examples/dashboard/03-storyboard.Rmd')`
````

```{r dashboard-story, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='An example story board.', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/dashboard-story.png', dpi = NA)
```

## Components {#dashboard-components}

A wide variety of components can be included in a dashboard layout, including:

1. Interactive JavaScript data visualizations based on HTML widgets.

1. R graphical output including base, lattice, and grid graphics.

1. Tabular data (with optional sorting, filtering, and paging).

1. Value boxes for highlighting important summary data.

1. Gauges for displaying values on a meter within a specified range.

1. Text annotations of various kinds.

1. A navigation bar to provide more links related to the dashboard.

The first three components work in most R Markdown documents regardless of output formats. Only the latter four are specific to dashboards, and we briefly introduce them in this section.

### Value boxes

Sometimes you want to include one or more simple values within a dashboard. You can use the `valueBox()` function in the **flexdashboard** package to display single values along with a title and an optional icon. For example, here are three side-by-side sections, each displaying a single value (see Figure \@ref(fig:dashboard-valueboxes) for the output):

````markdown
`r xfun::file_string('examples/dashboard/04-valueboxes.Rmd')`
````

```{r dashboard-valueboxes, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Three value boxes side by side on a dashboard.', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/dashboard-valueboxes.png', dpi = NA)
```

The `valueBox()` function is called to emit a value and specify an icon.

The third code chunk ("Spam per Day") makes the background color of the value box dynamic using the `color` parameter. Available colors include `"primary"`, `"info"`, `"success"`, `"warning"`, and `"danger"` (the default is `"primary"`). You can also specify any valid CSS color (e.g., `"#ffffff"`, `"rgb(100, 100, 100)"`, etc.).

### Gauges

Gauges display values on a meter within a specified range. For example, here is a set of three gauges (see Figure \@ref(fig:dashboard-gauges) for the output):

````markdown
`r xfun::file_string('examples/dashboard/05-gauges.Rmd')`
````

```{r dashboard-gauges, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Three gauges side by side on a dashboard.', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/dashboard-gauges.png', dpi = NA)
```

There are a few things to note about this example:

1. The `gauge()` function is used to output a gauge. It has three required arguments: `value`, `min`, and `max` (these can be any numeric values).

1. You can specify an optional `symbol` to be displayed alongside the value (in the example "`%`" is used to denote a percentage).

1. You can specify a set of custom color "sectors" using the `gaugeSectors()` function. By default, the current theme's "success" color (typically green) is used for the gauge color. The `sectors` option enables you to specify a set of three value ranges (`success`, `warning`, and `danger`), which cause the gauge's color to change based on its value.

### Text annotations

If you need to include additional narrative or explanation within your dashboard, you can do so in the following ways:

1. You can include content at the top of the page before dashboard sections are introduced.

1. You can define dashboard sections that do not include a chart but rather include arbitrary content (text, images, and equations, etc.).

For example, the following dashboard includes some content at the top and a dashboard section that contains only text (see Figure \@ref(fig:dashboard-text) for the output):

````markdown
`r xfun::file_string('examples/dashboard/06-text.Rmd')`
````

```{r dashboard-text, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Text annotations on a dashboard.', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/dashboard-text.png', dpi = NA)
```

Each component within a dashboard includes an optional title and notes sections. The title is simply the text after the third-level (`###`) section heading. The notes are any text prefaced with `>` after the code chunk that yields the component's output (see the second component of the above example).

You can exclude the title entirely by applying the `.no-title` attribute to a section heading.

### Navigation bar

By default, the dashboard navigation bar includes the document's `title`, `author`, and `date`. When a dashboard has multiple pages (Section \@ref(multiple-pages)), links to the various pages are also included on the left side of the navigation bar. You can also add social links to the dashboard.

In addition, you can custom links to the navigation bar using the `navbar` option. For example, the following options add an "About" link to the navigation bar:

```yaml
---
title: "Navigation Bar"
output:
  flexdashboard::flex_dashboard:
    navbar:
      - { title: "About", href: "https://example.com/about" }
---
```

Navigation bar items must include either a `title` or `icon` field (or both). You should also include a `href` as the navigation target. The `align` field is optional (it can be "left" or "right" and defaults to "right").

You can include links to social sharing services via the `social` option. For example, the following dashboard includes Twitter and Facebook links as well as a drop-down menu with a more complete list of services:

```yaml
---
title: "Social Links"
output:
  flexdashboard::flex_dashboard:
    social: [ "twitter", "facebook", "menu" ]
---
```

The `social` option can include any number of the following services: `"facebook"`, `"twitter"`, `"google-plus"`, `"linkedin"`, and `"pinterest"`. You can also specify `"menu"` to provide a generic sharing drop-down menu that includes all of the services.

## Shiny

By adding Shiny to a dashboard, you can let viewers change underlying parameters and see the results immediately, or let dashboards update themselves incrementally as their underlying data changes (see functions `reactiveFileReader()` and `reactivePoll()` in the **shiny** package). This is done by adding `runtime: shiny` to a standard dashboard document, and then adding one or more input controls and/or reactive expressions that dynamically drive the appearance of the components within the dashboard.

Using Shiny with **flexdashboard** turns a static R Markdown report into an interactive document. It is important to note that interactive documents need to be deployed to a Shiny Server to be shared broadly (whereas static R Markdown documents are standalone web pages that can be attached to emails or served from any standard web server).

Note that the [**shinydashboard**](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/) package provides another way to create dashboards with Shiny.

### Getting started

The steps required to add Shiny components to a dashboard are:

1. Add `runtime: shiny` to the options declared at the top of the document (YAML metadata).

1. Add the `{.sidebar}` attribute to the first column of the dashboard to make it a host for Shiny input controls (note that this step is not strictly required, but this will generate a typical layout for Shiny-based dashboards).

1. Add Shiny inputs and outputs as appropriate.

1. When including plots, be sure to wrap them in a call to `renderPlot()`. This is important not only for dynamically responding to changes, but also to ensure that they are automatically re-sized when their container changes.

### A Shiny dashboard example

Here is a simple example of a dashboard that uses Shiny (see Figure \@ref(fig:dashboard-shiny) for the output):

````markdown
`r xfun::file_string('examples/dashboard/07-shiny.Rmd')`
````

```{r dashboard-shiny, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='An interactive dashboard based on Shiny.', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/dashboard-shiny.png', dpi = NA)
```

The first column includes the `{.sidebar}` attribute and two Shiny input controls; the second column includes the Shiny code required to render the chart based on the inputs.

One important thing to note about this example is the chunk labeled `global` at the top of the document. The `global` chunk has special behavior within **flexdashboard**: it is executed only once within the global environment, so that its results (e.g., data frames read from disk) can be accessed by all users of a multi-user dashboard. Loading your data within a `global` chunk will result in substantially better startup performance for your users, hence is highly recommended.

### Input sidebar

You add an input sidebar to a flexdashboard by adding the `{.sidebar}` attribute to a column, which indicates that it should be laid out flush to the left with a default width of 250 pixels and a special background color. Sidebars always appear on the left no matter where they are defined within the flow of the document.

If you are creating a dashboard with multiple pages, you may want to use a single sidebar that applies across all pages. In this case, you should define the sidebar using a _first-level_ Markdown header.
