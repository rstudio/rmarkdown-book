# Shiny Documents

We have briefly introduced Shiny\index{Shiny} documents in Section \@ref(intro-shiny). Shiny is a very powerful framework for building web applications based on R. It is out of the scope of this book to make a comprehensive introduction to Shiny (which is too big a topic). We recommend that readers who are not familiar with Shiny learn more about it from the website https://shiny.rstudio.com before reading this chapter.

Unlike the more traditional workflow of creating static reports, you can create documents that allow your readers to change the parameters underlying your analysis and see the results immediately in Shiny R Markdown documents. In the example shown in Figure \@ref(fig:shiny), the histogram will be automatically updated to reflect the number of bins selected by the reader.

A picture is worth a thousand words, and a Shiny document can potentially show you a thousand pictures as you interact with it. The readers are no longer tied to the fixed analysis and conclusions in the report. They may explore other possibilities by themselves, and possibly make new discoveries or draw different conclusions.

## Getting started {#shiny-start}

You can turn any _HTML-oriented_ R Markdown documents to Shiny documents by adding `runtime: shiny` to the YAML metadata as a _top-level_ field, e.g.,

```yaml
---
title: "Shiny Document"
output: html_document
runtime: shiny
---
```

Note that the output format of the R Markdown document must be an HTML format. That is, the document should generate a web page (a `*.html` file). Non-HTML formats such as `pdf_document` and `word_document` will not work with the Shiny runtime. Please also note that some presentation formats are also HTML formats, such as `ioslides_presentation`, `slidy_presentation`, and `revealjs::revealjs_presentation`.

You can also create a new Shiny document from the RStudio menu `File -> New File -> R Markdown`, and choose the document type "Shiny" (see Figure \@ref(fig:shiny-new-document)).

```{r shiny-new-document, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Create a new Shiny document in RStudio.', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/shiny-new-document.png', dpi = NA)
```

To run a Shiny document in RStudio, you need to click the button "Run Document" on the editor toolbar (RStudio will automatically replace the "Knit" button with "Run Document" when it detects a Shiny document). If you do not use RStudio, or want to run the document in the R console for troubleshooting, you can call the function `rmarkdown::run()` and pass the filename to it.

You can embed Shiny inputs and outputs in your document. Outputs are automatically updated whenever inputs change. In the following example, we create a numeric input (`numericInput`) with the name `rows`, and then refer to its value via `input$rows` when generating output:

````markdown
`r ''````{r, echo=FALSE}
numericInput("rows", "How many cars?", 5)

renderTable({
  head(cars, input$rows)
})
```
````

```{r shiny-table, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Increase the number of rows in the table in a Shiny document.', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/shiny-table.png', dpi = NA)
```

In the above example, the output code was wrapped in a call to `renderTable()`. There are many other render functions in Shiny that can be used for plots, printed R output, and more. This example uses `renderPlot()` to create dynamic plot output:

````markdown
`r ''````{r, echo=FALSE}
sliderInput("bins", "Number of bins:", 30, min = 1, max = 50)

renderPlot({
  x    = faithful[, 2]  # Old Faithful Geyser data
  bins = seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = input$bins + 1)

  # draw the histogram with the specified number of bins
  hist(x, breaks = bins, col = 'darkgray', border = 'white')
})
```
````

```{r shiny-plot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Change the number of bins of a histogram in a Shiny document.', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/shiny-plot.png', dpi = NA)
```

## Deployment {#shiny-deploy}

Shiny documents must be supported by a live R session running behind the scenes. When you run a Shiny document locally, it uses your local R session. Usually only you can see and interact with the document. If you want to share the document with people who do not have R installed, or do not want to run the document locally, you will have to deploy the document on a server, and share the URL of the document. Then other people only need a web browser to visit your document.

There are two ways to deploy a Shiny document. You can either use a hosted service provided by RStudio, or set up your own server. The first way is technically easier, but sometimes you may not be allowed to use an external hosted service, so you have to install the required software (Shiny Server or RStudio Connect)\index{Shiny Server}\index{RStudio Connect} on your own server to deploy the Shiny documents.

### ShinyApps.io

You can publish Shiny documents to the ShinyApps (https://shinyapps.io) hosted service. To do this you, should ensure that you have:

1. An account on ShinyApps (use the signup form to request an account).

2. A latest version of the **rsconnect** R package. You can install this as follows:

    ```r
    install.packages("rsconnect")
    ```

You can then deploy an interactive Shiny document in the same way as how you currently deploy normal Shiny applications. From the working directory containing the document(s), just execute:

```r
rsconnect::deployApp()
```

If you are using RStudio, you can also use the `Publish` button available at the top-right of the window when running a Shiny document (see Figure \@ref(fig:shiny-deploy)).

```{r shiny-deploy, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Deploy a Shiny document to ShinyApps.io.', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/shiny-deploy.png', dpi = NA)
```

If there is a file named `index.Rmd` in the directory, it will be served as the default document for that directory, otherwise an explicit path to the Rmd file should be specified in the URL if you want to visit this Rmd document. For example, the URL for `index.Rmd` deployed to ShinyApps may be of the form `https://example.shinyapps.io/appName/`, and the URL for `test.Rmd` may be of the form `https://example.shinyapps.io/appName/test.Rmd`.

### Shiny Server / RStudio Connect

Both Shiny Server (https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server/) and RStudio Connect (https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/) can be used to publish Shiny documents. They require knowledge about Linux. Installing and configuring them should normally be a task for your system administrator if you are not familiar with Linux or do not have the privilege.

## Embedded Shiny apps {#shiny-embedded}

Besides embedding individual Shiny inputs and outputs in R Markdown, it is also possible to embed a standalone Shiny application within a document. There are two ways for this:

1. Defining the application inline using the `shinyApp()` function; or

1. Referring to an external application directory using the `shinyAppDir()` function.

Both functions are available in the **shiny** package (not **rmarkdown**), which will be automatically loaded when `runtime: shiny` is specified in the YAML metadata of the document, so you do not have to call `library(shiny)` to load **shiny** (although it does not hurt if you load a package twice).

### Inline applications {#shiny-embed-inline}

This example uses an inline definition:

````markdown
`r ''````{r, echo=FALSE}
shinyApp(

  ui = fluidPage(
    selectInput("region", "Region:",
                choices = colnames(WorldPhones)),
    plotOutput("phonePlot")
  ),

  server = function(input, output) {
    output$phonePlot = renderPlot({
      barplot(WorldPhones[,input$region]*1000,
              ylab = "Number of Telephones", xlab = "Year")
    })
  },

  options = list(height = 500)
)
```
````

Note the use of the `height` parameter to determine how much vertical space the embedded application should occupy.

### External applications

This example embeds a Shiny application defined in another directory:

````markdown
`r ''````{r, echo = FALSE}
shinyAppDir(
  system.file("examples/06_tabsets", package="shiny"),
  options = list(width = "100%", height = 700)
)
```
````

Note that in all of R code chunks above, the chunk option `echo = FALSE` is used. This is to prevent the R code within the chunk from rendering to the output document alongside the Shiny components.

## Shiny widgets {#shiny-widgets}

Shiny widgets\index{Shiny widget} enable you to create re-usable Shiny components that are included within an R Markdown document using a single function call. Shiny widgets can also be invoked directly from the console (useful during authoring) and show their output within the RStudio Viewer pane or an external web browser.

### The `shinyApp()` function

At their core, Shiny widgets are mini-applications created using the `shinyApp()` function. Rather than creating a `ui.R` and `server.R` (or `app.R`) as you would for a typical Shiny application, you pass the UI and server definitions to the `shinyApp()` function as arguments. We have given an example in Section \@ref(shiny-embed-inline).

The simplest type of Shiny widget is just an R function that returns a `shinyApp()`.

### Example: k-Means clustering

The **rmdexamples** package (https://github.com/rstudio/rmdexamples) includes an example of a Shiny widget implemented in this fashion. The `kmeans_cluster()` function takes a single `dataset` argument and returns a Shiny widget to show the result of k-Means clustering. You can use it within an R Markdown document like this:

````markdown
`r ''````{r, echo = FALSE}
library(rmdexamples)
kmeans_cluster(iris)
```
````

Figure \@ref(fig:shiny-widget-kmeans) shows what the widget looks like inside a running document.

```{r shiny-widget-kmeans, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='A Shiny widget to apply k-Means clustering on a dataset.', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/shiny-widget-kmeans.png', dpi = NA)
```

Below is the source code of the `kmeans_cluster()` function:

```r
kmeans_cluster = function(dataset) {

  library(shiny)  
  vars = names(dataset)

  shinyApp(
    ui = fluidPage(
      fluidRow(style = "padding-bottom: 20px;",
        column(4, selectInput('xcol', 'X Variable', vars)),
        column(4, selectInput('ycol', 'Y Variable', vars,
                              selected = vars[2])),
        column(4, numericInput('clusters', 'Cluster count', 3,
                               min = 1, max = 9))
      ),
      fluidRow(
        plotOutput('kmeans', height = "400px")  
      )
    ),

    server = function(input, output, session) {

      # Combine the selected variables into a new data frame
      selectedData = reactive({
        dataset[, c(input$xcol, input$ycol)]
      })

      clusters = reactive({
        kmeans(selectedData(), input$clusters)
      })

      output$kmeans = renderPlot(height = 400, {
        res = clusters()
        par(mar = c(5.1, 4.1, 0, 1))
        plot(selectedData(),
             col = res$cluster, pch = 20, cex = 3)
        points(res$centers, pch = 4, cex = 4, lwd = 4)
      })
    },

    options = list(height = 500)
  )
}
```

### Widget size and layout

Shiny widgets may be embedded in various places including standard full width pages, smaller columns within pages, and even HTML5 presentations. For the widget size and layout to work well in all of these contexts, we recommend that the total height of the widget is no larger than 500 pixels. This is not a hard and fast rule, but HTML5 slides can typically only display content less than 500px in height, so if you want your widget to be usable within presentations, this is a good guideline to follow.

You can also add an explicit `height` argument to the function that creates the widget (default to 500 so it works well within slides).

## Multiple pages {#shiny-multiple}

You can link to other Shiny documents by using the Markdown link syntax and specifying the *relative* path to the document, e.g., `[Another Shiny Document](another.Rmd)`. If you click the link to another Rmd document on one page, that Rmd document will be launched as the current interactive Shiny document.

Currently, only one document can be active at a time, so documents cannot easily share state, although some primitive global sharing is possible via the R script `global.R` (see the help page `?rmarkdown::run`).

By default, it is only possible to link to R Markdown files in the same directory subtree as the file on which `rmarkdown::run()` was invoked (e.g., you cannot link to `../foo.Rmd`). You can use the `dir` argument of `rmarkdown::run()` to indicate the directory to be treated as the root.

## Delayed rendering {#shiny-delay}

A Shiny document is typically rendered every time it is shown, and is not shown to the user until the rendering is complete. Consequently, a document that is large or contains expensive computations may take some time to load.

If your document contains interactive Shiny components that do not need to be rendered right away, you can wrap Shiny code in the `rmarkdown::render_delayed()` function. This function saves its argument until the document's rendering is done and has been shown to the user, then evaluates it and injects it into the output document when the computation is finished.

Here is an example that demonstrates how `render_delayed()` works. The code enclosed within the `render_delayed()` call will execute only after the document has been loaded and displayed to the user:

````markdown
`r ''````{r, echo = FALSE}
rmarkdown::render_delayed({
  numericInput("rows", "How many cars?", 5)

  renderTable({
    head(cars, input$rows)
  })
})
```
````

## Output arguments for render functions {#shiny-args}

In a typical Shiny application, you specify an output element in the UI using functions like `plotOutput()` and `verbatimTextOutput()`, and render its content using functions like `renderPlot()` and `renderPrint()`.

By comparison, in a Shiny document, the UI elements are often implicitly and automatically created when you call the `renderXXX()` functions. For example, you may want to use a `renderPlot()` function without having to create a `plotOutput()` slot beforehand. In this case, Shiny helpfully associates the corresponding output object to each `renderXXX()` function, letting you use Shiny code outside of a full Shiny app. However, some functionality can be lost in this process. In particular, `plotOutput()` can take in some optional arguments to set things like width and height, or allow you to click or brush over the plot (and store that information).

To pass options from `renderXXX()` to `xxxOutput()`, you can use the `outputArgs` argument, if it is available to a specific `renderXXX()` functions. For example, suppose that you want to render a plot and specify its width to be 200px and height to be 100px. Then you should use:

````markdown
`r ''````{r, echo = FALSE}
renderPlot({
  plot(yourData)
}, outputArgs = list(width = "200px", height = "100px")
)
```
````

No matter how many output arguments you want to set (all the way from zero to all possible ones), `outputArgs` always takes in a list (the default is an empty list, which sets no output arguments). If you try to pass in a non-existent argument, you will get an error like the following message (in this example, you tried to set an argument named `not_an_argument`):

```markdown
**Error**: Unused argument: in `outputArgs`, `not_an_argument`
is not an valid argument for the output function
```

To see `outputArgs` in action, run the R Markdown document below or visit https://gallery.shinyapps.io/output-args/ for the live version online. The document is interactive: brush over the image and see the `xmin`, `xmax`, `ymin`, and `ymax` values change (printed right under the image).

````markdown
`r xfun::file_string('examples/shiny-output-args.Rmd')`
````

### A caveat

We want to emphasize that you can only use this functionality within a Shiny R Markdown document (i.e., you must set `runtime: shiny` in the YAML metadata). But even if that is the case, this is only applicable to pieces of Shiny code that render output without the corresponding explicit output elements in the UI. If you embed a full Shiny application in your document and try to use `outputArgs`, it will be ignored and print the following warning to the R Markdown console (in this case, your `ui` function would be something like `ui = plotOutput("plot")`):

```markdown
Warning in `output$plot`(...) :
Unused argument: outputArgs. The argument outputArgs is only
meant to be used when embedding snippets of Shiny code in an
R Markdown code chunk (using runtime: shiny). When running a
full Shiny app, please set the output arguments directly in
the corresponding output function of your UI code.
```

The same will happen if you try to use `outputArgs` in any other context, such as inside a regular (i.e., not embedded) Shiny app. The rationale is that if you are already specifying a `ui` function with all the `output` objects made explicit, you should set their arguments directly there instead of going through this round-about way.
